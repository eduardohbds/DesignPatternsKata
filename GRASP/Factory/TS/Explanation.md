# Factory Method

We have two actors the created and the creator, to each of them you have to create a abstract.
In this case the IPizza and the IFabricaPizza is the created and the creator, respectively. 
The Fabric Method in this case is implemented this way. First the FabricaPizzas has a method criaPizzas and this method return a object of the pizza passed by parameter. Easy, don't you?
